.SYNOPSIS
This PowerShell script provides a function for searching for a list of keywords in ETL files. The function, called Search-ETL, accepts a list of keywords as input and searches all of the ETL files in the current directory for matches. It returns a list of objects, each of which has three properties: File, Line, and Match. The File property is the name of the ETL file that the match was found in, the Line property is the line number of the match, and the Match property is the actual line of text that matched the keywords.
